"stipend, ","The first step is to consider whether you have any negotiating room. Many companies have pre-designed summer internship programs that come with a specific rate or while others may pay by the hour, week or month. There is no point in negotiating an internship salary if the rate is fixed – at best, you are wasting your time, and at worst you are showing your naivety around company budgets. Internships without a particular salary already assigned to them may give you more room to bargain."

In here, the placement package is a number, in LPA, called Do note that CTC means Cost to Company, and not We in India realy love this term CTC instead of both on the employee as well as the employer end, because it allows employees to boast about their very low earnings and gives employers a chance to advertise higher pay than the employees are actually getting. What CTC means, true to its definition, is the amount of money the company spends on you in a year – the cost it incurrs due to the money it spends on you. What this means is that if the company gives you one plate of french fries everyday, it is allowed to include this into your whether you like or even accept that plate or french fries or not. Now substitute french fries with transport allowance, rental allowance, etc. etc. What a company includes in its CTC deferrs from company to company. Some company offers allowances and benefits on top of their advertised some would add french fries into it. Understand the difference. CTC always has a component called cash in hand, which is how much the employee gets paid in ehich is a fraction of the Both cash in hand and CTC and often also the benefits, which includes stuff like rental, health allowance and stock options, are important. Blindly comparing CTCs is stupid."

In the US, this translates to roughly 150k USD, which is great but not as extraordinary as getting a 1 Crore per year salary in India simply because of the living costs. Always consider this fact."
"CTC, ","The placement statistics of any college will love to highlight as high numbers as can theoretically be made possible. So it won’t show distinction between company types, where the person is placed (which country), breakdown of the etc. A CTC of 7 LPA where cash in hand is just 3 LPA, then the monthly salary before taxes is only 25k INR.
